Ingredients:

Spring roll wrappers (available at Asian grocery stores)
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers (any color)
1 cup bean sprouts
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Oil for frying
Instructions:

Prepare the Filling:

Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
Add shredded cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, and bean sprouts to the pan.
Stir-fry the vegetables for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly softened but still crisp.
Season the vegetables with soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), sesame oil, salt, and pepper.
Cook for another 1-2 minutes, then remove the pan from heat and let the filling cool.
Assemble the Spring Rolls:

Lay a spring roll wrapper on a clean surface with one corner pointing towards you (diamond shape).
Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper.
Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold the sides towards the center.
Roll the wrapper tightly away from you, sealing the edge with a bit of water to make sure it sticks.
Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling.
Fry the Spring Rolls:

Heat oil in a deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C).
Carefully place the spring rolls in the hot oil, seam side down, in batches to avoid overcrowding.
Fry the spring rolls for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the spring rolls from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
Repeat the frying process with the remaining spring rolls.
Serve:

Let the spring rolls cool for a few minutes before serving.
Serve the spring rolls hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, or plum sauce.
