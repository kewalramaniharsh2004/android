Ingredients:

4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 cup warm milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, chilled
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
Add the flour and salt to the yeast mixture and stir until a dough forms.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Shape the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.
Prepare the Butter Block:

While the dough is resting, place the chilled butter between two sheets of parchment paper.
Use a rolling pin to pound the butter into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.
Place the butter block in the refrigerator to chill until firm but still pliable.
Laminate the Dough:

Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.
Place the chilled butter block on one half of the dough rectangle.
Fold the other half of the dough over the butter to encase it completely.
Roll out the dough again into a large rectangle, then fold it into thirds like a letter.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to allow the butter to firm up.
Repeat the Folding Process:

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out again into a large rectangle.
Fold the dough into thirds like a letter, then wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for another 30 minutes.
Repeat this process two more times, chilling the dough between each fold.
Shape the Croissants:

After the final fold, roll out the dough into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.
Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into triangles.
Starting from the wide end of each triangle, roll up the dough tightly to form croissants.
Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each one.
Proof the Croissants:

Cover the shaped croissants with a clean kitchen towel and let them proof in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until they double in size.
Bake the Croissants:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Brush the proofed croissants with beaten egg wash.
Bake the croissants in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and flaky.
Remove the croissants from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.
Enjoy:

Serve the freshly baked croissants warm or at room temperature with your favorite toppings or fillings, such as jam, butter, or chocolate spread.
Enjoy your homemade croissants as a delicious breakfast treat or snack!
Making croissants from scratch requires a bit of time and effort, but the end result is definitely worth it. These flaky, buttery pastries are sure to impress your family and friends!
