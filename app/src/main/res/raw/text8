Ingredients:

1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups granulated sugar
1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup whole milk, at room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup boiling water
For the Chocolate Frosting:

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3 cups powdered sugar
1/3 cup whole milk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.
Prepare the Cake Batter:

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes until the batter is well combined.
Stir in the boiling water carefully until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.
Bake the Cakes:

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.
Make the Chocolate Frosting:

In a medium mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy using an electric mixer.
Gradually add the cocoa powder and powdered sugar, alternating with the milk and vanilla extract. Beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy. Add more milk if needed to reach your desired consistency.
Assemble the Cake:

Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand.
Spread a layer of chocolate frosting evenly over the top of the first cake layer.
Carefully place the second cake layer on top of the frosting.
Use the remaining frosting to frost the top and sides of the cake.
Serve and Enjoy:

Slice the chocolate cake into portions and serve it as is or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on the side.
Enjoy the rich and decadent homemade chocolate cake with your loved ones!
Feel free to decorate the chocolate cake with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or fresh berries for an extra special touch. Happy baking!
