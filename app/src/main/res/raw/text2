Ingredients:

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups mixed vegetables (such as bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, snap peas, and mushrooms), chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
Cooked rice or noodles for serving
Instructions:

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
Add minced garlic and ginger to the hot oil and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add chopped vegetables to the skillet. You can use any combination of vegetables you like. Stir-fry for about 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.
Pour soy sauce over the vegetables and toss to coat evenly. The soy sauce will add flavor and color to the stir fry.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Be mindful of the salt as soy sauce is already salty.
Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until everything is heated through and well combined.
Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Remove the skillet from heat and serve the vegetable stir fry hot over cooked rice or noodles.
Optionally, you can garnish with sliced green onions, sesame seeds, or chopped cilantro for extra flavor and presentation.
Enjoy your delicious and nutritious Vegetable Stir Fry!
