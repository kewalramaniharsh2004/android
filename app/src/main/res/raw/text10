Ingredients:

For the Batter:

1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
1 tablespoon gram flour (besan)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder (for color)
1 tablespoon yogurt (plain, unsweetened)
3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)
Oil or ghee for frying
For the Sugar Syrup:

1 1/2 cups sugar
1 cup water
A few strands of saffron (optional)
1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
1 teaspoon rose water (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Batter:

In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, gram flour, baking powder, and turmeric powder.
Add yogurt and water gradually, stirring continuously to form a smooth, lump-free batter. The batter should have a pouring consistency similar to pancake batter.
Cover the batter and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-10 hours or overnight. This fermentation process helps in making the jalebis soft and airy.
Make the Sugar Syrup:

In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely.
Add saffron strands (if using) and cardamom powder to the syrup. Allow it to simmer for 5-7 minutes until it reaches a one-string consistency. If you're not sure about the consistency, you can test it by taking a small amount of syrup between your thumb and index finger. It should form a single thread (one-string consistency).
Once the syrup reaches the desired consistency, remove it from the heat and add rose water. Mix well and set aside.
Fry the Jalebis:

Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.
Fill a piping bag or squeeze bottle with the fermented batter. Alternatively, you can use a zip-lock bag and snip off a small corner to make a DIY piping bag.
Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to form concentric circles or swirls. You can make small or large jalebis as per your preference.
Fry the jalebis until they turn crispy and golden brown on both sides. Use a slotted spoon to flip them occasionally for even frying.
Once done, remove the fried jalebis from the oil and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup. Ensure that the jalebis are fully coated in the syrup for a few seconds.
Serve the Jalebis:

Transfer the syrup-coated jalebis to a serving plate or tray. Garnish with chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios if desired.
Serve the jalebis warm or at room temperature as a delightful sweet treat.
Enjoy the crispy, syrup-soaked goodness of homemade jalebis with your family and friends!
