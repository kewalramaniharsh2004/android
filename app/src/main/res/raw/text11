Ingredients:

4 large flour tortillas
2 cups shredded cheese (such as cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)
1 cup cooked and shredded chicken, beef, or vegetables (optional)
1/2 cup chopped onions (optional)
1/2 cup chopped bell peppers (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil or butter (for cooking)
Salsa, sour cream, guacamole, or other toppings (for serving)
Instructions:

Prepare the Fillings:

If using, cook and shred the chicken, beef, or vegetables. You can season them with your favorite spices, such as cumin, chili powder, or garlic powder.
Chop the onions, bell peppers, and cilantro if using.
Assemble the Quesadillas:

Lay out the flour tortillas on a clean surface.
Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese evenly over one half of each tortilla.
If desired, add a layer of cooked and shredded chicken, beef, or vegetables on top of the cheese.
Sprinkle the chopped onions, bell peppers, and cilantro evenly over the filling, if using.
Top with another 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.
Fold and Cook the Quesadillas:

Fold the empty half of each tortilla over the filling to create a half-moon shape.
Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and add olive oil or butter.
Once the skillet is hot, carefully transfer the assembled quesadillas to the skillet, one or two at a time, depending on the size of your skillet.
Cook the quesadillas for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted.
Use a spatula to flip the quesadillas halfway through cooking to ensure even browning and melting.
Repeat with the remaining quesadillas, adding more oil or butter to the skillet as needed.
Serve the Quesadillas:

Once the quesadillas are cooked, remove them from the skillet and transfer them to a cutting board.
Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut each quesadilla into wedges.
Serve the warm quesadilla wedges with your favorite toppings, such as salsa, sour cream, guacamole, or hot sauce.
