Ingredients:

1 cup powdered milk
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp baking soda
2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)
2-3 tbsp milk (adjust as needed)
Oil or ghee for frying
For Sugar Syrup:
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
A few strands of saffron (optional)
1/2 tsp cardamom powder
Instructions:

Prepare Sugar Syrup:

In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.
Bring it to a boil and simmer until the sugar dissolves completely.
Add saffron strands (if using) and cardamom powder.
Simmer for another 5 minutes until the syrup slightly thickens.
Keep the syrup warm while you prepare the gulab jamuns.
Prepare Gulab Jamun Dough:

In a mixing bowl, combine powdered milk, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.
Add ghee and mix well to form a crumbly mixture.
Gradually add milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead until you get a soft and smooth dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
Shape Gulab Jamuns:

After resting, knead the dough again for a minute.
Divide the dough into small, smooth balls about the size of a marble, ensuring there are no cracks.
Roll each ball between your palms until smooth and place them on a plate.
Fry the Gulab Jamuns:

Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat.
Once the oil is hot, lower the heat to low and carefully add the gulab jamuns, a few at a time, without overcrowding the pan.
Fry the gulab jamuns, stirring gently occasionally, until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked from all sides.
Remove the fried gulab jamuns using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing them on a paper towel.
Soak in Sugar Syrup:

While the gulab jamuns are still warm, gently immerse them in the warm sugar syrup.
Allow the gulab jamuns to soak in the syrup for at least 2-3 hours, preferably overnight, to absorb the flavors and become soft and spongy.
Serve:

Serve the gulab jamuns warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.
