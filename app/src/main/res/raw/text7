Ingredients:

2 cups long-grain white rice
4 cups water
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Green onions, chopped, for garnish (optional)
Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Rice:

Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
Add the rinsed rice to the boiling water, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.
Once cooked, remove the rice from heat and let it cool completely. For best results, refrigerate the cooked rice for a few hours or overnight before making fried rice.
Cook the Eggs:

Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.
Pour the lightly beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a minute until they start to set.
Using a spatula, gently scramble the eggs until they are cooked through but still slightly moist. Transfer the cooked eggs to a plate and set aside.
Prepare the Fried Rice:

In the same skillet or wok, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
Add minced garlic and finely chopped onion to the skillet and sauté until fragrant and translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the mixed vegetables and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they are heated through and slightly tender.
Add the cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps with a spatula or wooden spoon. Stir-fry the rice with the vegetables for 3-4 minutes, allowing it to heat through and absorb the flavors.
Pour soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice and vegetables. Stir well to evenly distribute the sauces and coat the rice with a nice savory flavor.
Season the fried rice with salt and pepper to taste, adjusting the seasoning as needed.
Add the Eggs and Garnish:

Return the cooked eggs to the skillet with the rice and vegetables. Stir-fry for another minute or until everything is well combined and heated through.
Remove the skillet from heat and transfer the fried rice to serving plates or a large platter.
Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds for added flavor and visual appeal, if desired.
Serve Hot:

Serve the delicious homemade fried rice as a satisfying main dish or as a side dish alongside your favorite Asian-inspired entrées.
Enjoy your flavorful and comforting fried rice straight from the skillet to your plate!
Feel free to customize the fried rice recipe by adding protein options like cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu, and additional vegetables such as bell peppers, broccoli, or mushrooms to suit your taste preferences. Happy cooking!
