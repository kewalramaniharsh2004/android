Ingredients:

1 cup basmati rice
2 cups mixed vegetables (such as carrots, peas, potatoes, cauliflower), chopped
2 onions, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
2 green chilies, chopped (optional)
Whole spices (2 cloves, 2 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
1/4 teaspoon saffron strands (optional)
2 tablespoons ghee or oil
Salt to taste
Fried onions (optional, for garnish)
Cashews and raisins (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:

Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.
In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the whole spices (cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick) and cumin seeds. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
Add the sliced onions and green chilies (if using). Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.
Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to separate.
Stir in the mixed vegetables and cook for 3-4 minutes until they are slightly tender.
Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot. Mix well with the vegetables.
Add yogurt, chopped cilantro, mint leaves, garam masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to taste. Stir everything together until well combined.
Pour 2 cups of water into the pot. If using saffron strands, soak them in a tablespoon of warm milk and add to the pot for extra flavor and color.
Cover the pot with a lid and cook the biryani over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the vegetables are tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 2 whistles.
Once done, turn off the heat and let the biryani sit for 5 minutes before opening the lid.
Fluff the biryani gently with a fork and garnish with fried onions, cashews, and raisins if desired.
Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or any curry of your choice.
Enjoy your flavorful and aromatic Vegetable Biryani!
