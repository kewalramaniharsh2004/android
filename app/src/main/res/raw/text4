2 cups mixed vegetables (such as carrots, peas, potatoes, cauliflower), chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch ginger, grated
1 green chili, finely chopped (optional, adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon cooking oil
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) for garnish
Instructions:

Heat oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter.
Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.
Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chili (if using). Sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and become mushy.
Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, ground cumin, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground cardamom. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
Add the mixed vegetables to the pan and stir to coat them with the spice mixture.
Pour in the coconut milk and mix well. Bring the curry to a simmer.
Cover the pan and let the curry cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
Once the vegetables are cooked through, sprinkle garam masala over the curry and mix well.
Taste the curry and adjust salt and spices according to your preference.
Garnish the vegetable curry with fresh cilantro leaves before serving.
Serve hot with steamed rice, naan, or roti.
